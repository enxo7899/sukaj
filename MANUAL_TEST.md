# 🧪 Manual Test - Cron Didn't Run

## Why Cron Didn't Run

Vercel cron jobs need:
1. **Pro Plan** (free tier has limited crons), OR
2. **Manual setup** in Vercel dashboard

Since we don't see cron logs, let's **test manually** by calling the endpoints directly!

---

## ✅ Manual Test - Call Endpoints Directly

### Option 1: Use curl (From Your Computer)

```bash
# 1. Process rent due
curl https://sukaj.vercel.app/api/cron/process-rent-due

# 2. Send SMS (this will actually send SMS!)
curl https://sukaj.vercel.app/api/sms/rent-due
```

### Option 2: Visit in Browser

Just open these URLs in your browser:

1. **Process rent:** https://sukaj.vercel.app/api/cron/process-rent-due
2. **Send SMS:** https://sukaj.vercel.app/api/sms/rent-due

---

## 🔐 Expected Results

### Process Rent Endpoint:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "processed_at": "2025-10-28T19:53:00.000Z",
  "total_processed": 1,
  "total_paid_last_month": 0,
  "total_unpaid_last_month": 1,
  "details": [...]
}
```

### Send SMS Endpoint:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "SMS notifications sent",
  "propertiesFound": 1,
  "tenantsSent": 1,
  "ownersSent": 1
}
```

Then **check your phone!** 📱

## 🔧 If You Want Automatic Crons

### Option A: Upgrade to Vercel Pro
- $20/month
- Unlimited cron jobs
- Go to vercel.com → Upgrade

### Option B: Set Up Cron Jobs in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Click **Settings** → **Cron Jobs**
3. If you see the crons from `vercel.json`, enable them
4. If not, you might need Pro plan

### Option C: Use GitHub Actions (Free!)
Create `.github/workflows/daily-cron.yml`:

```yaml
name: Daily Rent Processing

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 5 * * *'  # 5 AM UTC - Process rent
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # 6 AM UTC - Send SMS

jobs:
  process-rent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.schedule == '0 5 * * *'
    steps:
      - name: Process rent due
        run: |
          curl https://sukaj.vercel.app/api/cron/process-rent-due

  send-sms:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.schedule == '0 6 * * *'
    steps:
      - name: Send SMS reminders
        run: |
          curl https://sukaj.vercel.app/api/sms/rent-due
```

This will run automatically every day for **FREE!**
